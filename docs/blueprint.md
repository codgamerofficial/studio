## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to reflect the sky and weather.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F8FF) to give a clean, airy feel with very low saturation of the sky blue.
- Accent color: Warm Orange (#FFB347) for interactive elements and highlights, for good contrast and a different 'feel' than sky blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to make it a bit more friendly.
- Use a set of easily recognizable and modern icons for different weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) and calendar events.
- Clean and modern layout, dividing content into clear, distinct sections for weather details, calendar, and location search.
- Smooth transitions when updating weather conditions and calendar entries. Subtle animations can show movement (e.g., animated rain or clouds).
